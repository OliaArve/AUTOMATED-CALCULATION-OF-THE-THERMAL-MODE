AUTOMATED CALCULATION OF THE THERMAL MODE

The article concerns creation of the program for calculation of the thermal mode in the device case. The program is written in the C# programming language. The program consists of two conditional parts: calculation of the minimum overall dimensions of the printed circuit board and calculation of average temperature of printed circuit boards, depending on quantity of the mounting boards, located in a instrument case. On the obtained data the designer makes the decision what type of the cooling system has to be chosen for establishment of the normal thermal mode, or about need of introduction of the compulsory cooling system (application of a so-called cooler). The program executes the simplified calculations. In particular, for a case, when the chips located on a mounting board have the casing of identical type. The program has educational character and is inten-ded for the students studying the subject "Designing of Measuring Instruments", however, professionals, can apply to the solution of specific objectives in the field of heat exchange.
